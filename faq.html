                <h3>1. I like the V-AAP co-branded voucher - how do I get it?</h3>
                <p>Browse through “DISCOVER” on the V-AAP mobile app. Just click "Buy Now", (the offer ends when the stock runs low). Once successfully purchased, the voucher will be loaded on to your mobile app. You can use the voucher at participating partner stores.</p>
                <h3>2. Do I need to make use of my co-branded V-AAP vouchers immediately?</h3>
                <p>No as with all vouchers, there is an expiry date. Just use the vouchers before the expiry date stated.</p>
                <h3>3. I bought/have a voucher - how do I use it?</h3>
                <p>Once the e-voucher is bought, it will be loaded on to your mobile app. It has redemption instructions on it! All you need to do really, is to present the e-voucher in-store via your mobile phone. Or if the vouchers are in the physical form, just state in advance that you will be paying with the co-branded V-AAP vouchers and present them at point of sale, when checking out. It is that simple.</p>
                <h3>4. Can I buy a voucher as a gift for someone else?</h3>
                <p>Yes. You can spread the joy and buy V-AAP vouchers as gifts, and unless the fine print specifically states otherwise, gift away!</p>
                <h3>5. Is V-AAP safe?</h3>
                <p>Extremely. Your credit card number is transmitted by SSL encryption directly to a secure, virtual vault. At no time is your credit card information stored on our servers. Nonetheless, this security only applies if you log out of your V-AAP account after use! So remember to keep your V-AAP account secure by logging out after every use.</p>
                <h3>6. If I don’t use the full value of the voucher in one visit, can I use the remainder later?</h3>
                <p>No. As with all vouchers, value or service is to be used at one visit. There is no refund on the unutilised amount.</p>
                <h3>7. Can I combine my voucher with other offers or specials?</h3>
                <p>Rules of use will be stated on the voucher. It is the retailer’s decision whether it can be combined with other offers or specials. Do check on the detailed terms and conditions of use.</p>
                <h3>8. Who is behind V-AAP? Where is the company based?</h3>
                <p>V-AAP is powered by the WIND Group. We are made up of a group of experienced people from the retail industry whose combined experience makes the group a centurion. We are located in the heart of Singapore, at Paya Lebar Square.</p>
                <h3>9. How can I recommend V-AAP to a friend?</h3>
                <p>There are many opportunities to recommend V-AAP to a friend. In the V-AAP mobile app, you can share the programme with your friends. You can also use the mobile app to send invitations to friends using Facebook.</p>
                <h3>10. What does it cost to use V-AAP?</h3>
                <p>The V-AAP programme is completely free. Just download the app, find the voucher you like and click buy or scan it into the mobile app for “e” use.</p>
                <h3>11. What do I need to register?</h3>
                <p>We need you to create an account, so that we can store your vouchers into your account. This way you can check your vouchers easily whenever your like. <em>Your personal information is private and will not be shared with external</em></p>
                <h3>12. Why do you need my location?</h3>
                <p>We need your location to enhance your experience using V-AAP. For example, we use your location to send you alerts when you are in the vicinity of a mall or retailer that accepts V-AAP. We also send reminder alerts when you are within the vicinity of malls and retailers that accept your co-branded V-AAP vouchers when they are close to expiring.</p>
                <h3>13. Why do you need my email address?</h3>
                <p>We use your email primarily, to bind your account and provide login features.</p>
                <p>It also helps if you change your mobile number in the future. We can then use your e mail address as a secondary verification. And since we have your email address, you will also be able to enjoy updates on the latest fantastic offers that are relevant to you.</p>
                <h3>14. How can I be sure that my details will not be shared with your partners?</h3>
                <p>All your personal particulars will be safely stored in a secure vault. To ensure its safety, the information is also encrypted while it is transmitted online. Our partners will not have access to your personal particulars. Only trends will be shared so they can conceptualise more meaningful and relevant promotions for you; and even that, only if authorised.</p>
